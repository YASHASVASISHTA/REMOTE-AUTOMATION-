# REMOTE-AUTOMATION-
Welcome to the Remote Automation project! This project enables secure remote automation of tasks on a PC using email as the communication medium. With this setup, anyone from anywhere can send commands via email to the PC, triggering various actions, such as opening files, initiating torrent downloads, and more.

The system involves two email accounts: one for the user who initiates the commands and another for the PC that executes the specified tasks. Both email accounts are secure and under your control, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the PC and perform automation tasks.

Security: The email accounts involved in this project are secure as they are exclusively in your possession. The PC's email account is configured securely using Google App Passwords, and Gmail is utilized for communication, minimizing hacking risks. Additionally, encryption can be employed for sensitive data, further enhancing security.


This is the video demonstration showcasing the process of sending an email via Gmail to open applications like Shareit and Matlab.

Confirmation Email: Upon successful execution of scheduled tasks, the PC will send a confirmation email back to the user's email account. This confirmation mechanism provides the user with feedback on task completion, ensuring transparency and keeping the user informed about the status of their automation commands.
